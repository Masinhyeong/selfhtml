    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for des
    cribing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Al
    though most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces
     written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, inclu
     ding plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other m
     edia. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most we
     bsites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and u
     ser interfaces for many mobile applications.
